# CodeEnhance: LLM-Generated Python Code Enhancement Through SAST Integration and Fine-Tuning

## Overview

**CodeEnhance** is an open-source framework for enhancing the security and quality of Python code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework combines automated validation using Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools (e.g., Pylint, Bandit) with targeted LLM fine-tuning, resulting in code that is more secure, functionally correct, and production-ready.

This repository contains:
- Source code for the two-stage CodeEnhance framework
- Experiment scripts and evaluation tools
- Benchmark datasets and sample prompts
- Pre-trained/fine-tuned model checkpoints (optional, if allowed)
- Instructions for replicating the experiments in our paper

## Features
- **Stage 1: Code Generation** 
    - Code generation with additional prompt

- **Stage 2: Iterative Validation & Refinement Pipeline**
    - Automatic syntax checking (Pylint)
    - Security vulnerability detection (Bandit)
    - Functional correctness verification via LLM self-reflection
    - Structured feedback loop for code refinement

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- [OpenAI Python SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-python)
- [Pylint](https://pylint.org/)
- [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/)

### 2. Code Structure

The repository includes two main scripts for core functionalities:

- **Prompted Code Generation** (`Code Generator.py`):  
  Generates Python code for each prompt using your selected LLM, automatically including a structured docstring with Input Prompt, Intention, and Functionality fields.

- **Automated Validation Pipeline** (`Code Validator.py`):  
  Runs syntax checks (Pylint), security scans (Bandit), and functional correctness validation (LLM self-evaluation) on the generated code, iteratively refining until requirements are satisfied or the maximum attempt count is reached.
